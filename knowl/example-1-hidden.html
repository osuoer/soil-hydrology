Recall that the isothermal compressibility of water, bw, is about 4.8 x 10-10 m2/N. The percentage change in volume of water is 100 x bw x the change in pressure = 0.048%. Since the material is mostly gas filled when the pressure is this low, this very small change in volume will be undetectable.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The solid phase may be as complicated or simple as you like. Typically composed of largely inert minerals (rock, gravel, sand, silt and clay), solid constituents may include roots, carbon, and other highly reactive substances. Note that in this discussion we have slighted the semi-solid or soft tissue “goo” such as microbes, plants and worms that are prevalent in the vadose zone. These components are very important to understanding the chemical behavior of the unsaturated zone, and are discussed in chapter 4.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To get yourself in the proper frame of mind, pretend you are an ant. What humans consider to be uniform porous medium now looks lumpy and irregular. Although this may seem all too obvious, it is crucial to consider this problem in detail. To do this we will have to introduce the basic parameters used to conceptualize a porous media. First, let’s identify the constituents which we will concern ourselves with: the mass and volume of each phase; gas, liquid and solid. As identified in Figure 2.1a, the volume and mass of phase i are identified as Vi and Mi respectively.</p>
