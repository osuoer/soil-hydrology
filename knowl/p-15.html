<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We have two choices then: 1) throw up our arms, and figure that natural systems are hopelessly complex, or, 2) make some reasonable simplifying assumptions. For the sake of progress, we will opt for the latter option (however tempting the former). We will assume that there is some volume, much larger than the grains of the porous medium, yet smaller than the distance between dissimilar regions, which provides a representative sample of our porous medium. This volume is referred to as the Representative Elementary Volume (REV) for the system (Bear, 1972). Each extensive property of the medium is defined at a point by its value calculated taking V to be one REV about that point. We do get around to a more complete analysis of this problem in chapter 6 where we explicitly address scale dependent variability.</p>
