</h6>Gardner left things here, but it is interesting to push the calculation one step further. When in Somalia I went to a place a few hundred miles from the hottest inhabited place on earth. I was surprised to learn that the water table was only about 3.5 m below the surface, despite the fact that the most recent major recharge event occurred thousands of years ago. Can we estimate the time it takes a water table to drop from the surface in time using Gardner’s result? Well, officially Gardner’s result is for a steady-state system, but let’s just assume that the system changes slowly enough that this assumption is satisfied. What will the maximum rate of water table decline? If the average loss of water in the profile is θe, then the rate of water table decline will be qmax/θe. We then may write<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\frac{dz} {dt} = \frac{q_{max}} {\theta_{e}} = \frac{K_{s}} {\theta_{e} [\exp(\alpha z) - 1]}}\tag{2.1.1}
\end{equation}
</div>Solving for dt and integrating, we find the time for the water table to reach a depth z is approximately<div xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="displaymath">
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{t = \frac{\theta_{e}} {K_{s}} \left[\frac{\exp (\alpha z) - 1} {\alpha} - z\right]}\tag{2.1.2}
\end{equation}
</div>For typical values of these parameters for a silty soil (say α=5/m, Ks=1m/d and θe=0.2) the time to reach a depth of 3.5 m is predicted to be 4,400 years, which matches my observations pretty well. It is interesting to note that to drop another 0.5 m would take 50,000 years! It is further instructive to think about how a desert society which relies on a shallow depth to groundwater is effected by the introduction of mechanical pumps which can drop the water table by up to a meter per year.</div>
