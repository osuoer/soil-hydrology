<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We are concerned with describing the retention and movement of fluids in natural porous media. This objective fits neatly into a single sentence, however the challenge of attaining this goal remains to be met to the degree required to solve many contemporary problems in environmental sciences and engineering. Nonetheless, there are many powerful tools at our disposal. In this chapter we will cover the basic physical properties upon which much of the remainder of the text rests. If all goes well you will get a “feel” for both the physical processes which control flow through porous media and the conceptual and mathematical approaches we employ to characterize the processes. Having a well balanced understanding from both perspectives is essential; you must be able to guide your application of mathematical solutions based on a clear and accurate intuitive concept of what you are trying to describe.How do you describe a chunk of moist porous medium? What are some basic features which would allow you to abstract that chunk of material in terms of a set of mathematical parameters which will assist in describing: the way in which it might dry; how rain falling on it would soak in (and how much would run off); and what would happen to it if you spilled some gasoline on it? We require a system of measurable quantities for a porous medium that may be used in addressing the broadest possible set of questions about how fluids will interact with it under a variety of conditions. Porous media is characterized by a set of parameters selected to provide as concisely as possible the greatest insight into the response of the media to a range of physical processes. In this section we identify the fundamental parameters employed in describing both the media and the fluid of interest, and introduce the fundamental equations of motion for fluids in porous media.</p>
