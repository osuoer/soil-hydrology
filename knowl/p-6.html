<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> The gaseous phase is generally dominated by the major constituents of the atmosphere; N2, O2, CO2, H2O vapor etc. Clearly, as microbes and plant roots respire, a soil’s CO2 and CH4 content may become significantly elevated, while in industrially contaminated sites there may be significant levels of organic vapors. By and large we keep track of the state of the gaseous phase in the soil just as we do in the atmosphere; we consider the partial pressures of each of the constituents, and keep track of the partitioning of each compound. Primary parameters of interest, then, include the gas diffusivity, and the partial pressure versus temperature relationship, and the Henry’s law coefficient (Henry’s law states that at a given temperature, for low concentrations, there is a linear relationship between the partial pressure of the gas and the concentration of the material in the liquid phase). It is noteworthy that transport of gaseous phases are dominated by molecular diffusion which generates about 2 cm/day of spreading, while molecular diffusion in the liquid phase is 100 times less effective in contaminant mass movement. <a class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> The movement of gaseous phase constituents is also a function of the changes in atmospheric pressure, which generates a pumping effect, as noted by Buckingham (1904) and Weeks (1979). Of course, gaseous phase movement can also be driven by liquid phase movement, as is the case of a saturated wetting front pushing gas down through a profile during flood irrigation. Gas phase transport has received renewed interest with the advent of soil vapor extraction (SVE) as a remediation technique for volatile organics. In this procedure, gas is pumped out of the vadose zone through a well, taking the volatile fraction of contamination with it.</p>
